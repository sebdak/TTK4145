TASK 1:
1. Why do we assign priorities to tasks?
	- Because some task are more important than others, and must be executed within a certain time frame.

2. What features must a scheduler have for it to be usable for real-time systems?
	- the processes must allways meet their deadlines
	- the process execution time must be less than its deadline


TASK 2:
separate attachment


TASK 3:
1. what is priority inversion?
	- When a lower priority task blocks a higher priority task from executing by using 

unbounded priority inversion
	- the higher priority task may never get access to a resource because it is locked by another task.

2. Does priority inheritance prevent deadlocks?
	-no, you can still get deadlocks. 
	Ex: if task 1 locks res A -> task 2 locks res B -> task 1 wants to access res B -> task 2 wants to access res A


TASK 4:
1. There are a number of assumptions/conditions that must be true for the utilization and response time tests to be usable (The "simple task model"). What are these assumptions? Comment on how realistic they are.
****** denne er tatt fra lf. fant ikke noe litteratur ******** 
	-The application has a fixed set of processes
	-All processes are periodic with known periods
	-The processes are independent of each other
	-All processes have deadline equal to their period
	-All processes have a fixed worst-case execution time
	-All context-switching costs etc. are ignored
	-No internal suspension points (e.g., delay or blocking I/O)
	-All processes execute on a single CPU
2. separate attachment
3. separate attachment. Response-time. is the task set schedulabe?
	- the test shows that the task set is schedulable. this is different from the utilization test in (2). response-time analysis is sufficient and necessary, while utilization test if only sufficient.
